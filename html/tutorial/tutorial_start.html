                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <h3>Welcome to Battlecon! This fantasy strategy card game encapsulates the principles of fighting video games, and delivers
                an action packed experience that will test your prediction, positioning, and forward thinking. Before we talk about what Battlecon
                is like to play, let's get a bit of phrasing out of the way.</h3>

                <h1>Terminology</h1>
                <h3>Battlecon is a turn based game. Each turn will involve preparing a move to throw at an opponent, each player revealing their
                move, and then resolving each person's action accordingly. In Battlecon each game turn is called a BEAT.</h3>
                <h3>An attack in Battlecon is formed by a STYLE card (which will have red backs) and a BASE card (blue backs). These two cards
                paired together create the ATTACK PAIR.</h3>
                <h3>Styles are all unique to a character, while the Bases you pair them with are shared by every character. There is one exception 
                to this rule, and that is called the UNIQUE BASE. Each character has a Unique Base, which they can pair with their styles.</h3>
                <h3>If this is starting to get confusing, head back to Battlecon Visual and mess around with some of the Attack Pairs (currently 
                Unique Bases are not included, so just pair Styles with standard Bases).</h3>
                <h3>If you see how these cards match up, then you may see that they each have printed values. Any given Attack Pair has RANGE,
                POWER, and PRIORITY. These values are important to remember, and will be explained later. In short, the Range is where the attack 
                hits, the Power is how hard the attack hits, and the Priority is the speed of the attack. A Base has a flat value for these three
                numbers, while Styles add or subtract value from these. For Range, if a Style has a list of values (ex. Range: "+1~2"), These values 
                add in every possible way to create the maximum list of values possible. For example, Shot (Range 1~4) works with Martial (Range +0~1)
                to cover every range from 1 to 5. The minimum values of these ranges are 1 and +0, and the maximum are 4 and +1, and every number in 
                between 1 and 5 can be created by a pair of numbers from these sets.</h3>
