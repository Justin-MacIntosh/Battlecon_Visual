            <h4>Welcome to Battlecon Visual! This is a tool designed to make learning about Battlecon a little bit easier.</h4>
            <h4>This page is all about the attack pair. On the page you can currently see the 6 Standard Bases. 
            Clicking on any one of them will place them in the attack pair. Their properties will be listed on the left.</h4>
            <h4>Selecting a character, using the "Characters" button on the right, will pull up that character's Styles. 
            You can move back and forth between Styles and Bases with the buttons on the top.</h4>
            <h4>Selecting both a Style and a Base will complete the attack pair. The properties of the entire pair will be 
            listed on the left, and the statistics of the pair will be listed on the right. In this way it is easy to visualize 
            the effectiveness of a given pair.</h4>
