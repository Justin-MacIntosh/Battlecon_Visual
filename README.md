# Battlecon_Visual

##Overview
This project is based on Battlecon: War of Indines, Battlecon: Devestation of Indines, and Battlecon: Fate of Indines.

This is a web tool designed as a pseudo replacement for the wiki of the Battlecon Trilogy. The wiki of these games is purely factual, which makes visual learning of characters difficult. With this site, users will be able to mix and match attack pairs, seeing how different combinations work together.

Battlecon Visual hopes to become a Visual Wiki of the trilogy, and help break down another barrier to entry for the series. TODO functionality includes spelling out each character's unique ability, including a range example board, linking to the helpful BattleGuides YouTube Series, and more.

In the distant future, Battlecon Visual may also serve as a tutorial for newer players. Battlecon Visual can step by step walk newere players through learning the game. Since Battlecon is a deceptively easy game, a gentle guide with a good grasp of the fundamentals may be able to garner attention from a variety of players.

##Running
This project is being run on XAMPP for now. IF you want to run your own version, first download a version of XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Then, clear the htdocs within xampp's main directory. Add all of the code from this repository into the htdocs folder, and run your XAMPP server. On whatever localhost port your XAMPP server runs on, a version of Battlecon Visual should be there.

##Current Features
Currently, Battlecon Visual can match a base with a style, and present the user with the statistics and properites of the pair. Along with the visual understanding that comes with seeing the pair together, the properties are laid out in turn order, for easy reading.

Two characters are able to be chosen at this point, Eligor Larington and Shekhtur Lenmore.

By pressing the Style and Base Headers of the page, a user can flip between selecting the current style and selecting the current base.
